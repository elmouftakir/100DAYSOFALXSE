
##100DaysOfALXSE Challenge

 is an exciting initiative designed with #ALXSE to help individuals enhance their coding skills and foster a sense of accountability in their learning journey.
Participants commit to dedicating at least one hour each day to coding for 100 consecutive days. During this time, they document their progress and share updates with the community using the designated hashtag.
The challenge provides a structured framework for consistent practice, encourages continuous learning, and builds a supportive network of like-minded individuals.
Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, joining the challenge can help you stay motivated, track your progress, and connect with others who share your passion for coding.

As the challenge is open to learning anything, I will dedicate it to enhancing my database skills and acquiring new programming skills.
